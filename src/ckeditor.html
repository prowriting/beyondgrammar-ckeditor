        Novalk Djokovic is set to miss the US Open after one of his doctors made an announcement that he will need six to
        twelve weeks to recovers from a elbow injury.

        But Andy Murrey's chances of playing at Flushing Meadows would appear more positive, with the Scot continuing
        his rehabilitation from a hip problem.
    </p>

    <p>
        The last grandslam of the year starts in just under five weeks on August 28, meaning Djokovic will run out of
        time if the latest assessment is correct.

        <b>Injured Djokovic starting to consider a break away from tennis</b>
        <br />The 12-time major champion was forced to retire injured during his Wimbeldon quarter-final against Tomas
        Berdych earlier this month and said after the match that he had been feeling pain in his right elbow for over a
        year and a half. According to
        his physio its not doing very well. If he does return he will be more likely to injure it again.
    </p>

    <p>
        He has since been seeking advice from specialists, including Serbian doctor Zdenko Milinkovic, who said
        Djokovic is suffering from a "bruised bone due to excessive playing".
    </p>

    <p>"Nole must rest for six to 12 weeks," Milinkovic told Sportski Zurnal, a sports newspaper in Serbia.</p>

    <p>
        The next examination will know wether this asdsessment stays or changes. During this period, he is not going to
        train with a racket but he will run other sessions, such as fitness and the like.
